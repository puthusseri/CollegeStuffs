\begin{frame}[fragile]{Style Based GAN}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Introduced by NVIDIA 
        \item Improved the efficiency of GAN by improving the generator
        \item Introduced new automated metrics - perceptual path length and linear seperability
        \item Result was  : new dataset Flickr Face HQ (FFHQ) of size 2.56 TB
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Style Based Generator}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The weights are studied through the 8 layer affine transformation.
        \item Feature maps are normalized using AdaIN
        \item Generate \textit{stochastic details} by introducing the explicit noise for each layer.
        \item Final resulting feature maps are passed to the discriminator.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Image Quality }
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Comparing with CelebA-HQ with FFHQ based on Frechet inception distances (FID) , a great improvement happens
        \item Used truncation trick
        \item Used 26.3M parameters for training
        \item Generated image is of 1024 * 1024 resolution
    \end{itemize}
