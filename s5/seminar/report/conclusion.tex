\begin{Conclusion}

The computational complexity of the GAN mainly depends on the complexity of the generator network. By using the style based generator architecture the computational complexity gets reduced upto a large extent. As the techniques like batch normalization, dropouts etc are not used in this architecture, the features of the images that can be generated can exponentially increase with less time. Also FFHQ database of images generated by the StyleGAN can be widely used for both finding solutions to both research and industrial problems.
